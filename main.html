	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is concept that measures the anount of time an algorith takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.
	It helps in determining how efficient an algorith is. An efficient algorithm runs in the least possible time for all inputs. </p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept that measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. 
		It is expresses as function of the lenght of the input.
		For example, an algorithm with space complexity of <b>O(n)</b> means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.
