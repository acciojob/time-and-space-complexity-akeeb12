    <p>
        Time complexity is a concept that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is. An efficient algorithm runs in the least possible time for all inputs.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept that measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. It is expressed as a function of the length of the input. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of <b>O(n)</b> means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.
